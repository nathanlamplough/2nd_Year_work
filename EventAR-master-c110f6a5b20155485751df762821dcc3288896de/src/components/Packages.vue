          Search and browse through event plan packages created by users. Each package includes the list of vendors used to run a specific type of event. Packages provide inspiration, and help you get started on planning your own event. You can easily
            save packages and edit them to meet your requirements, or create your very own using the interactive board. The interactive board enables you to gather and categorise all your ideas in one place.
