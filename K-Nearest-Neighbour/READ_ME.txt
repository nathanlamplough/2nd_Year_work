To run the code simply open the KNN.sln file in visual studio and run

Before you run you will need to change the file paths in the ReadTrainCSV, ReadTestCSV and OutputAccuracy functions which are all located inside the Program.cs class as the paths are currently for my pc.

If you wish to just read the class files/code I have placed copies inside KNN_just_classes folder

Please use the adult.test and adult.train.5fold in the data folder inside the KNN folder as I had to change
the column names since before they contained "." which were not compatible with C#

If you need any help running the code please email me at nlamp001@gold.ac.uk
